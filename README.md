web app to determine capacity to use a forklift

This project works as a deliverable for a company, to help in one process, usually performed by a nurse or a healthcare professional, so it can be determined by a series of questions and medical information, if the worker is capable of safely maneuver a forklift.

For this a web app form is created, that determines if the worker is authorized to use the forklift and register it in a Excel document.
